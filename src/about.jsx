  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="/images/profile-placeholder.jpg" alt="My headshot" width="150" />
  <p><strong>Legal Name:</strong> Yuvraj Singh</p>
  <p>
    My journey into technology started with a deep curiosity for how 
    software powers the world around us. Over time, that curiosity turned 
    into a passion for <strong>programming, problem-solving, and creating 
    tools that make life easier</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond coding, I value <strong>teamwork, creativity, and continuous 
    learning</strong>. I believe every project is an opportunity not only 
    to sharpen my technical skills but also to grow as a collaborator 
    and innovator. 
  </p>
  <p>
    When I’m not working on projects, I enjoy exploring new technologies, 
    experimenting with ideas, and building small applications that challenge 
    my thinking. I also take inspiration from fields like 
    <em>cybersecurity, AI, and cloud computing</em>, which I’m eager to 
    explore further in my career.
